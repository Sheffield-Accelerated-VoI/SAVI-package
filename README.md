## SAVI - Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information

### What SAVI does

Using only PSA results from your model

In a matter of seconds from the SAVI online application you can generate:

* Standardised assessment of uncertainty (C-E planes and CEACs)
* Overall EVPI per patient, per jurisdiction per year and over your decision relevance horizon
* Expected Value of Perfect Parameter Information (EVPPI) for single and groups of parameters

### How to run SAVI

SAVI is an R Shiny application that runs within a web browser. 
After loading the SAVI R package the SAVI shiny app can be launched using the command SAVI().

An online version of the SAVI application is hosted at http://savi.shef.ac.uk/SAVI/.
